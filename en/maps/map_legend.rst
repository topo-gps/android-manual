To view the legend, you have to tap the map copyright button. The map copyright button is the button on which it says: ‘Map: ....’ in the bottom left of the map screen. Next you have to select the tab ‘Legend’ in the bottom. You can also view the Legend via :ref:`Menu <ss-menu>` > More by selecting the tab ‘Legend’ in the bottom.

If you open the Legend of the topographic map of Great Britain you will see the following screen:
