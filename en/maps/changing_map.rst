.. _sec-change-map:

Changing current map
====================

In the maps screen (:ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Maps) you can change the current map and :ref:`purchase additional maps <sec-purchase-maps>`.

Suppose we the main map is currently the topographic map of Great Britain, as in the example below.

.. figure:: ../_static/map-change1.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Main map screen Great Britain Topo GPS
   
   *The main screen with the topographic map of Great Britain.*
   
We now want to change it to the OpenStreetMap map. For that we open the maps screen (:ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Maps).
An example of the map screen is shown below:

.. figure:: ../_static/map-change2.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Maps screen Topo GPS
   
   *The maps screen in which you can change the map and purchase additonal maps.*
   
The maps screen consists of two sections, the purchases and the :ref:`store <sec-purchase-maps>`. All purchased maps are accessible. If you tap
on an map item in the purchases section the map will be opened immediately and you will return to the main screen.

In the example above, the OpenStreetMap map was :ref:`purchased <sec-purchase-maps>`. If we tap the OpenStreetMap item, the main map will be changed to OpenStreetMap and we will return to the main screen automatically as in the example below.

.. figure:: ../_static/map-change3.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Main map screen OpenStreetMap Topo GPS
   
   *The map in the main screen was changed to OpenStreetMap.*

If the newly choosen map has coverage in the previously shown area, the newly opened map is zoomed to the previously shown area. Otherwise, the newly opened map is zoomed to the area it covers.
