Modifying map screen
--------------------
You can modify the map screen by moving, zooming, centering and rotating.

Move
~~~~
To move the map you have to hold a finger on the map. When you move your finger, the map will be moved as well. You can also move the map by making a quick swipe with your finger on the map.

.. _subsec-zoom:

Zoom
~~~~
- *Zooming in:* Tap one finger on the bottom of the map. Or hold two fingers on the map and bring them together.
- *Zooming out:* Tap one finger on the top of the map. Or hold two fingers on the map and move them away from each other.

If you do not like zooming in with one tap on the bottom of the map and zooming out with one tap at the top, you can
swap this in the :ref:`settings <ss-settings-onetapzoom>`. You can also change there bottom/top into left/right.

.. _subsec-center:

Center
~~~~~~
By pressing the position marker symbol on the bottom left of the screen, the map will be centered around your current location. An example
is shown in the figure below.
 
.. figure:: ../_static/map2.png  
   :alt: Kaart centreren Topo GPS

   *A centered map.*

- *Move:* If you are moving, the map will stay centered automatically. The map will move with your movement.
- *Zoom in* If you zoom in by tapping on the bottom of the map, the map stays centered.
- *Zoom out:* If you zoom out by tapping on the top of the map, the map stays centered.
- *Cancel:* By dragging the map, or by zooming with two fingers the centering will be canceled.

If the location determination does not function, please check the settings of your iPhone/iPad. Go to
Settings -> Privacy -> Location -> Topo GPS.

.. _subsec-roteren:

Rotate
~~~~~~
You can rotate the map in two ways, automatic or manual. Both options are discussed below.

.. _ss-map-autorotate:

Automatic rotation
******************
By pressing once on the position marker icon on the bottom left of the screen, the icon turns into a rotation icon as you can see in Figure 2. If you press this rotation icon, the map will be rotated.

The map is then rotated such that the top of the map indicates the direction in which you point your iPhone/iPad. If you are moving the top of the map will indicate the direction in which you move. An example is shown in the figure below:

.. figure:: ../_static/map3.png  
   :alt: Kaart roteren Topo GPS

   *A rotated map.*

Rotating the map can be useful when you are following a route. Left and right on the map are than also left and right in reality. In addition the position maker will stay centered on the map.

If the map is rotated, an arrow will appear on the top left of the screen. This arrow indicates the direction of the true north on the map. If you press this arrow the rotation will be cancelled.

You can cancel rotation by pressing the position marker icon. Rotation is also canceled by pressing the north arrow.

If you move the map or zoom with two fingers automatic rotation will be switched off. The current rotation angle will then not longer changed and the map will not longer be centered at your current location.

Manual rotation
***************
If you put two fingers on the screen and make a rotation gesture, the map will be rotated around the point that lies in between the two fingers. An example of a rotated map is displayed in Fig. 3. You can rotate the map in every desired direction. 

If the map is rotated, an arrow will appear on the top left of the screen. This arrow indicates the direction of the true north on the map. If you press this arrow the rotation will be cancelled.

If you zoom the map or move the map the map stays rotated.

Manual rotation can be cancelled by pressing the north arrow. It is also possible to undo the rotation by rotating back to the normal situation.
