Loading routes
--------------
To load routes on the map, you have to press the :ref:`route button <subsec-route-button>` on the right hand side of the :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>`.

An example of the the routes screen that appears is displayed below:

   *Figure 1. An example of the routes screen that appears when pressing the route button on the map screen.*

A list of routes appears in the routes screen. In the example above there are three: 
Gower Hike, Midhurst Fields, and Lake District Walk.

Directly below the titles of the routes you can see the route type and 
the length of the route. If the route is recorded, the time is displayed as well. Also it is shown how far away the route is from the center of the currently visible part of the map.

To load a route on the map, you have to press the title of the preferred route. 

As an example we now will load the route ‘Gower Hike’. The result is shown in the figure below.

   *Figure 2. The route ‘Gower Hike’ has been loaded on the map.*

The map moves and zooms automatically so that the complete route is visible on the map. The blue line indicates the route. The white arrows on the blue line indicate the direction of the route.

The 13.5 km on the top right of the :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>` indicates the length of the route. For this the symbol 'rte' is used.

If you want to see the route in more detail, you can :ref:`zoom in <subsec-zooming>` on the map.

You can alter the color, width, and transparency of the route line in the :ref:`settings <ss-settings-lines>`.

If you press once more on the :ref:`route button <subsec-route-button>` on the right-hand side of the :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>`, you can see that the ‘Gower Hike’ route has obtained a gray background color.  This means that this route is currently loaded. To go back to the map, you can press 'Map' on the top left.

   *Figure 3. In the route screen it can be seen that the route ‘Gower Hike' is loaded on the map.*

It is also possible to load multiple routes on the map. This can be useful if you want to combine or compare different routes. If you press an unloaded route in the routes screen it will be added to the map, just as the first loaded route. The route line however will be different from the first route. 

You can alter the color, width, and transparency of all route lines in the :ref:`settings <ss-settings-lines>`.
