The waypoint details screen contains information about the waypoint, such
as the title and the coordinates. If available you can also find here a description, photos, a phone number and/or an URL.

The physical address of a waypoint is also displayed in the details screen.

If the address of a waypoint is still unknown, Topo GPS will look up this address in a database of Apple. For this you have to enable the option :ref:`Addresses - find automatically <settings-addresses>` in the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>`. You have also to be connected to the internet.

With the button on the top right of the waypoint details screen you can load or unload a waypoint from the map.

In the bottom of the waypoint details screen you can find a tool bar with the following buttons:

- ‘<‘ and ‘>’: Allows you to browse through the list of waypoints, or through the waypoints that are loaded on the map.
- Trash icon: Allows you to :ref:`remove the waypoint from your device <ss-waypoint-remove>`.
- Share/Export icon: Allows you to :ref:`share the waypoint <ss-routes-share>`.
- ‘Edit’: Allows you to :ref:`edit the waypoint <ss-waypoint-edit>`.
