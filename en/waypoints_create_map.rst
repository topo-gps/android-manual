Creating waypoints
==================
There are several ways of creating waypoints in Topo GPS.

- Pressing long on the map and dragging the icon to the desired location.
- Entering an address in the address search tab via Menu > Search.
- Entering a coordinate in the coordinate tab via Menu > Search.
- Scanning a coordinate with the coordinate scanner via Menu > Search.
- Importing a geodata file which contains waypoints via Menu > Waypoints > More > Import file.
- Saving the current location as a waypoint by pressing the position marker and then 'Save' or 'Create waypoint'. 
- Taking a photo via Menu > Camera.
- Adding waypoints via the waypoints screen > More > +.

In this section we will explain how to create a waypoint directly on the map.

Creating waypoints on the map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By pressing long on the map an icon will appear. An example is shown in the figure below:

.. figure:: _static/waypoint-create-map1.jpg
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Waypoint press long on map Topo GPS

   *Figure 1. By pressing long on the map an icon will appear.*

As long as you hold your finger on the map you can drag the circle to the
desired location. If you release your finger a screen will appear in which you can
set the properties of the waypoint.

   *Figure 2. Screen in which you can set the properties and save the waypoint.*

If you wish you can give the waypoint a title, set the icon and enter a description.

If you are connected to the internet and you have enabled ‘Adresses - Find automatically’ in the :ref:`settings <subsec-settings>`, an automatic suggestion for the waypoint title will appear. This title has a light grey color and will be used if no title has been entered. In the example of Fig. 2 the suggestion is ‘Dartmoor National Park’.

If we now enter ‘Geocache’ as a title and press ‘Save’ the waypoint will be saved on your device. The waypoint will be loaded on the map with the title as is illustrated in the figure below:

.. figure:: _static/waypoint-map3.png
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Waypoint add Topo GPS

   *Figure 3. The waypoint ‘Geocache’ has been added to the map.*

A waypoint that is created from the map will be stored on your device. Hence, this waypoint will appear in the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>`.
