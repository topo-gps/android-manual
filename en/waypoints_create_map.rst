Creating waypoints
==================
There are several ways of creating waypoints in Topo GPS.

- Pressing long on the map and dragging the icon to the desired location.
- Entering an address in the address search tab via Menu > Search.
- Entering a coordinate in the coordinate tab via Menu > Search.
- Scanning a coordinate with the coordinate scanner via Menu > Search.
- Importing a geodata file which contains waypoints via Menu > Waypoints > More > Import file.
- Saving the current location as a waypoint by pressing the position marker and then 'Save' or 'Create waypoint'. 
- Taking a photo via Menu > Camera.
- Adding waypoints via the waypoints screen > More > +.

In this section we will explain how to create a waypoint directly on the map.

Creating waypoints on the map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By pressing long on the map an icon will appear. An example is shown in the figure below:

   :width: 320px
   :alt: Waypoint press long on map Topo GPS

   *Figure 1. By pressing long on the map an icon will appear.*

As long as you hold your finger on the map you can drag the icon to the
desired location. If you release your finger a waypoint creation screen will appear in which you can
set the properties of the waypoint.

   *Figure 2. Waypoint creation screen in which you can set the properties and save the waypoint.*

If you wish you can give the waypoint a title, set the icon and enter a description.

If you are connected to the internet and you have enabled ‘Adresses - Find automatically’ in the :ref:`settings <subsec-settings>`, an automatic suggestion for the waypoint title will appear. This title has a light grey color and will be used if no title has been entered. In the example of Fig. 2 the suggestion is ‘Southwood Farm Lane’. If you wish to have a waypoint without a title please enter a single space.

As an example we enter ‘Goal A’ as a title. If you press ‘Save’ the waypoint will be saved on your device and loaded on the map with the title as is illustrated in the figure below.

   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Waypoint added to map Topo GPS

   *Figure 3. The waypoint ‘Goal A’ has been added to the map.*

The waypoint that is created from the map is saved on your device and hence will appear in the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>`.

If you accidentally pressed long on the main map so that an icon appeared, you can drag this icon to the top or bottom of map screen. It will then be removed and the waypoint creation screen will not pop up. Also if you press 'Cancel' in the waypoint creation screen, the waypoint will not be created.

If enter a description in the waypoint creation screen, you can view it in the waypoint details screen. The waypoint details screen will be opened by tapping on a waypoint that is loaded on the map.
