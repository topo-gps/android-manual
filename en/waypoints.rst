Waypoints
=========

A waypoint is a location that can be added to the map. The icon and the title of the waypoint are shown on the map. Possible other additional information such as photos and a description can be displayed by tapping the waypoint. Waypoints can be loaded on the map and can be imported in and exported to various formats.

Waypoints can be managed from the waypoints screen which can be loaded by tapping :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Waypoints.
