Searching addresses and places
==============================

To search addresses and places you first have to open the search screen via :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Search.
Then select the ‘Address’ tab above the keyboard.

A screen will appear in which you can enter addresses and place names. 

Loading single search result
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As an example we now will enter the town ‘Selborne’ in the search box. While typing search results will appear in the
list below the search box, as you can see below:

   *Searching the town ‘Selborne’*

In order to be able to find addresses or places you have to be connected to the internet. Searching will occur via a service
of Apple.

If you tap on a search result in the list, it will be loaded on the map as a waypoint and you will return to the main screen. 
An example is shown below:

   *The search result ‘Selborne’ has been loaded on the map.*

In the settings (Menu > More > Settings) you can control whether used search results are automatically saved as a waypoint. The default setting is not to save automatically in order not to clutter your list of waypoint with search results. If you want to save search result as a waypoint, you could tap it to open the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`. There you can tap 'Save' in the bottom right to save the search result.

Loading all search results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can also search on a keyword, like for example ‘Pub’.  The results that appear in the list depend on 
the area that is currently visible in the map screen. If you search for Pub and the map is zoomed to Selborne, only
pubs near Selborne will show up, like in the figure below:

   *Searching for ‘Pub’.*

If you tap a single search result, it will be loaded on the
map. You can also load all results, by pressing ‘Search’ on
the bottom right of the screen. This is illustrated
in the figure below:

If you now search for ‘Camping’, a list of campings near Selborne will appear,
as you can see in the figure below:

If you only want to load a few of the results on the map, you have to press long on one of the desired results.

Removing search resuls from the map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To remove a search result from the map, tap the search result to open the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`. The tap 'Remove from map' in the top of the screen. To remove all search results at once (including all loaded other waypoints), tap :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Waypoints > More > Remove all from map.


Search result details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want to view the details of a search result, you can press the info (i) button on the right
hand side of the title in the list with search results. The :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>` of a search result will then appear.

Searching with search history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your searches will be saved in the search history. This can be disabled in the :ref:`settings <ss-search-settings>`.

If the search field is empty, the search history will appear below the search field. An example
is displayed below:

.. figure:: _static/search-address8.png

   *If the search field is empty, the search history will be displayed.*

If you tap a result from the history, it will be searched, and its results will be placed on the map. 

For example, it is now easy to search for pubs at another location. Just
move the map, and tap ‘Pub’ from the search history. 

Clearing search history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can remove all results from the search history by pressing the ‘Clear’ button on the right hand side of the label ‘Search history’.
