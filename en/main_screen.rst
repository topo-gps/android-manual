Main screen
===========
If you start Topo GPS a map will be displayed at first. An example is shown below: 

.. figure:: _static/map1.png  
   :alt: Topo GPS main screen

   *Figure 1. The map screen of Topo GPS. The red marker indicates your current location.*

To find your location on the map you have to press the position marker icon on the bottom left of the screen.

The red marker with the arrow in Figure 1 indicates your current location on the map. 
The direction of the arrow points in the direction in which you point your device if you stand still. When you are moving, this arrow points in the direction you are moving. You can find more information about the marker in the section :ref:`sec-posmarker`.

The dark gray area at the bottom of the screen is the dashboard. In the dashboard
you will find the center button, the route button and a few counters. The
dashboard is discussed in detail in the section :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>`.

The dark gray rectangle with the three dots on the upper right of the screen is a handle with which you can open the :ref:`menu <sec-menu>`.

The label on the upper left side of the map indicates the percentage offline accessible map tiles of the area that is currently displayed. You can read more in the section :ref:`Downloading maps for offline use <sec-cache>`.

On the bottom right corner of the map you can find a scale indicator. In Fig. 1, the black horizontal line indicates a distance of 200 m. Using the scale indicator you can quickly estimate the distance between two points on the map. You can determine distances more accurately using the :ref:`route planner <ss-route-plan>` in
crow fly mode.

On the bottom left corner of the map you will find the copyright
information of the current map. If you press on the label you can view
more detailed :ref:`information <ss-copyright>` and a :ref:`legend
<ss-legend>` if available.

A red circle around the position marker indicates an estimate of the accuracy of the location determination. When you do not see this circle or if you do not find it useful, you can switch it on or off in the settings.

An arrow that indicates the map north can be switched on in the settings.
