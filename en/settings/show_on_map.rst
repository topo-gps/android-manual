Show on map
===========
In the section 'Show' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can enable and disable the following settings:

Location accuracy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you enable this setting a circle indicating the accuracy of the position determination will appear around the :ref:`position marker <sec-posmarker>`. 

True north
~~~~~~~~~~
If you enable this setting an arrow pointing to the direction of the true north will always appear on the top left of the :ref:`main screen <sec-main-screen>`.
On most topographic maps the top of the map does not point exactly to the true north.
