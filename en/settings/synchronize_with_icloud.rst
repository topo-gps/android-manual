Synchronize with iCloud
=======================
In the section 'Synchronize with iCloud' of the :ref:`settings <sec-settings>` you can determine the behavior of iCloud synchronization.

If you enable the switch 'Routes and Waypoints' your :ref:`routes <sec-routes>` and :ref:`waypoints <sec-wp>` will be :ref:`synchronized with iCloud <ss-routes-synchronize-icloud>`. They are then also available on your other devices and they are backed up.

If you enable 'Use mobile network' iCloud synchronization is also possible over cellular network if you also have enabled 'Mobile data' in the iOS iCloud settings.
