Single tap zoom in/out
======================
In Topo GPS you can zoom the map in or out with a single tap on the map screen. By default, tapping on the bottom is zooming in, tapping on the top is zooming out.

In the section 'Single tap zoom/in out' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can control the behavior of the single tap zoom.

You can choose between the following options:

- *Bottom / Top* - Tapping on the bottom is zooming in, tapping on the top is zooming out.
- *Top / Bottom* - Tapping on the top is zooming in, tapping on the bottom is zooming out.
- *Left / Right* - Tapping on the left is zooming in, tapping on the right is zooming out.
- *Right / Left* - Tapping on the right is zooming in, tapping on the left is zooming out.
