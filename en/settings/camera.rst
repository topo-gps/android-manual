Camera
======

In the section 'Camera' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can determine the pixel size of the photos taken with the :ref:`camera <sec-camera>`.

You can choose between:

- *Small*: 1024 x 768 pixels
- *Normal*: 1536 x 1152 pixels
- *Large*: 2048 x 1536 pixels
- *Extra large*: 2560 x 1920 pixels

Larger photo sizes imply sharper photos, but also require more storage space.

This setting is only relevant for the photos stored in Topo GPS. If you have enabled access to selected photos your photo library in the :ref:`iOS device settings <sec-settings-device>` the photos are always saved in the original resolution in your photo library.
