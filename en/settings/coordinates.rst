Coordinates
===========

In the section 'Coordinates' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can determine which coordinate types are displayed in the app. The shown coordinate types in the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`, the :ref:`current location screen <sec-posmarker>` and the :ref:`coordinate panel <ss-coordinate-panel>` are determined by this setting.

If you tap displayed coordinate types a screen will appear in which you can enable and disable coordinate types. An example of this screen is shown below:

.. figure:: ../_static/settings-coordinate1.png
   :height: 320px
   :width: 568px
   :alt: Displayed Coordinate types Topo GPS
   
   *Setting the displayed coordinate types.*

In the figure above, only WGS84 decimal and Ordnance Survey national grid are enabled. If you go a the waypoint details screen, you see in the 'Coordinates' section that also only these coordinate types are shown:

.. figure:: ../_static/settings-coordinate2.png
   :height: 320px
   :width: 568px
   :alt: Displayed Coordinate types Topo GPS
   
   *Only WGS84 decimal and Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinates are shown in the waypoint details screen.*
   
As a second example we now enable other coordinate types, MGRS, WGS84 degree, minutes seconds, and UTM. The settings screen looks then as follows:

.. figure:: ../_static/settings-coordinate3.png
   :height: 320px
   :width: 568px
   :alt: Displayed coordinate types Topo GPS
   
   *Setting the displayed coordinate types.*

In the waypoint details screen the 'Coordinates' section then only shows WGS84 degree minutes seconds, UTM and MGRS coordinates:
   
.. figure:: ../_static/settings-coordinate4.png
   :height: 320px
   :width: 568px
   :alt: Displayed coordinate types Topo GPS
   
   *Only WGS84 degree minutes seconds, UTM and MGRS coordinates are shown.*
