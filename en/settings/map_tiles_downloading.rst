Map tiles downloading
=====================

In the section 'Map tiles downloading' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can find the switch 'Use cellular network'.

If you disable 'Use celluar network' map tiles will never be downloaded over a cellular network. This can prevent unwanted cellular downloads if you move the map to an area on which map tiles were not :ref:`stored offline <sec-cache>`. Limiting cellular downloads could save you money, depending on your contract. The drawback is that you sometimes could see :ref:`gray maps <sec-gray-map>`.

If you enable 'Use cellular network' map tiles can be downloaded over a cellular network. In addition you should enable Topo GPS to use the cellular network in the :ref:`iOS device settings <sec-settings-device>`.
