Search results
==============
In the section 'Search results' of the :ref:`settings <ss-settings>` you can control several options of :ref:`searching addresses and places <sec-search-addresses>`.

If you enable 'Save as waypoint' all search results that you add to the map are automatically saved as a :ref:`waypoint <sec-wp>` and will appear in the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>`.

If you enable 'Save history' all search queries are stored in the :ref:`search history <ss-search-history>`.
