Scanning coordinates
====================

Topo GPS contains a coordinates scanner. The coordinates scanner can scan coordinates and show them on the map. You obtain the best results by scanning coordinates printed on paper. Scanning coordinates shown on a display is also possible. Scanning handwritten coordinates does not function very well.

Scanning coordinates is most often much faster and more accurate than :ref:`entering the coordinates <sec-entering-coordinates>`. 

To open the coordinates scanner, tap :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Search. Then select the 'Camera' tab in the bottom.

To use the coordinates scanner you need to give Topo GPS permission to access your camera in the iOS Settings.

If you open the coordinates scanner you see the image of the camera. In the center there is a lighter rectangle. Place the rectangle above a coordinate. You can zoom in and out with two fingers to focus the rectangle on the coordinate. An example is shown below:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates1.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *Scanning coordinates with the coordinates scanner.*
   
If you have placed the coordinates in the rectangle and focussed the camera the coordinate will be recognized automatically and shown on the map, as in the example below:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates2.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *Coordinates have been scanned and are shown on the map.*
   
In the top of the screen you see the position of the coordinate on the map. In the bottom you see the scanned image. You can use it to verify that the coordinate was scanned correctly. If you tap 'Save' the coordinate is saved as a :ref:`waypoint <sec-wp>` and the coordinates scanner screen is opened again. As a second example we will scan MGRS coordinates:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates3.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *Scanning MGRS coordinates*

Ater the coordinates are recognized, again a map with the coordinates will be shown:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates4.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *MGRS coordinates have been scanned and shown on the map.*

Again you can tap 'Save' to save coordinates and return to the coordinate scanner screen. 
As a last example we now will scan Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinates:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates5.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *Scanning OSNG coordinates*

Ater the coordinates are recognized, again a map with the coordinates will be shown:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates6.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *OSNG coordinates have been scanned and shown on the map.*

Tap 'Save' to return to the coordinates scanner screen.

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates7.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *The coordinates scanner screen with 3 saved results.*
   
In the top left of the coordinates scanner screen you see 'Map (3)'. The number next to map indicates the number of saved coordinates. If you tap 'Map' you will return to the main screen and the map will be zoomed to the scanned coordinates as you can see in the example below:

.. figure:: ../_static/scanning-coordinates8.jpg
   :height: 760px
   :width: 351px
   :alt: Scanning coordinates Topo GPS
   
   *The three scanned coordinates are shown on the main map.*
