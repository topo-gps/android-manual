Entering coordinates
====================
To enter a coordinate you have to open the :ref:`menu <sec-menu>` and press the ‘Search’ icon. If the ‘Coordinate’ tab has not been opened yet, you have to stil to press the ‘Coordinate’ tab just above the keyboard.

A screen will appear in which you can enter coordinates, like in the
figure below.

Coordinate type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To enter a coordinate you have first to make sure that the right coordinate type has
been set. If you press the ‘Type’ cell a screen will appear in which you can
change the coordinate type, like in the figure below:

   *Figure 2. Choosing the coordinate type.*

You can choose between different coordinate types, including:


- `WGS84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84>`_ decimal

- `WGS84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84>`_ degrees minutes

- `WGS84 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84>`_ degrees minutes seconds

- `UTM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM>`_

- `MGRS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGRS>`_

- `OSNG (Ordnance Survey National Grid) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey_National_Grid>`_

- `NZTM2000 (New Zealand Transverse Mercator) <http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-system/datums-projections-and-heights/projections/new-zealand-transverse-mercator-2000>`_

Entering coordinate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have set the right coordinate type, you can enter the coordinate.

Depending on the position of the center of the map, the first digits of
the coordinate are already entered. This speeds up entering coordinates
if the coordinate is not located far from the center of the map.

As an example we now will enter the WGS coordinate decimal
coordinate 51.56321 -4.28942, see Fig. 1. 

As long as we do not enter a title, the suggested title will be used
as a title for the waypoint. If we press ‘Save’ the coordinate will be saved
and put on the map. The coordinate screen will be cleared, so that
you can add a second coordinate. The first digits will now be based on the previous input. On the top left of the screen a Map button will appear, with with you can return to the map. The number behind map tells you how many coordinates have been entered.

We now will enter a second coordinate: N 51°34’01.9” W 4°16’41.9”, as is illustrated below. To enter this coordinate we had to change the type to WGS degree, minutes second.

   *Figure 3. Entering the coordinate N 51°34’01.9” W 4°16’41.9”.*

Again we are happy with the suggested title and press save. The coordinate will be put on the map and the coordinate screen will be cleared, so that you can enter the next coordinate.

Now will we enter the OSNG coordinate SS 41996 88847, as is illustrated below.

After pressing ‘Save’ the coordinate will be added to the map and the coordinate
screen will be cleared as you can see in the figure below:

   *Figure 5. To show the three entered coordinates on the map you have to press the ‘Map’ button.*

Displaying on map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After entering the coordinates, you can return to the map screen by
pressing the map button on the top left. The number of successfully entered
coordinates is displayed on the map button. After entering the three 
coordinates in the examples above the map screen looks as follows:

   *Figure 6. Three entered coordinates are put as waypoints on the map.*


Entering a list of coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you have received a list of coordinates in text format, you
could enter them one-by-one via the coordinate input screen, 
as is explained above.

It could however be easier to select and copy these coordinates. Then
select the tab ‘Address’ and then press long on the search box. 
A paste button will appear as is illustrated in the figure below:

.. figure:: _static/search-coordinate7.png

   *Figure 7. Pasting a list of coordinates into the address search box.*

If you press ‘Paste’ the list of coordinates will be inserted and processed.
The resulting coordinates will be displayed in the list below the search
box, as is illustrated in the figure below:

   *Figure 8. A list of coordinates has been pasted into the search box.*

You can now load individual coordinates on the map, by tapping them. By pressing long on a result you can make a selection of results that you would like to load on the map. If you press ‘Search’ on the bottom right, all results will be loaded on the map, like in the figure below:
