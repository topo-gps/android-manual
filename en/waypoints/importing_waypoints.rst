Importing waypoints
===================

It is possible to import waypoints in Topo GPS in the following file formats: gpx, kml/kmz, csv and geojson.
Files of these types can also be imported if they are compressed in a zip file.

To import waypoints you could try to tap on a file icon. Most often an app picker will show up. You then 
have to select 'Open with Topo GPS' or 'Copy to Topo GPS' and the file will be imported in Topo GPS.

Alternatively you could open the waypoints screen in Topo GPS (Menu > Waypoints) and tap More > Import file. Then the files app will be opened. Here you can select a cloud storage, like iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive. Then you can browse through your files and select the files you want to import.

If the waypoints were imported succesfully, you will return to the main map screen and the map will be zoomed to the imported waypoints.
In the waypoints screen (Menu > Waypoints) all imported waypoints can be found in a newly created folder.



Importing waypoints from iMessage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

iOS 14
------
Opening geodata files in iMessage in iOS 14 is unfortunately not very intuitive.

If you tap on a geodata attachment (for example gpx) in an iMessage conversation, most often nothing will happen.
For some file formats, like zipped gpx a screen appears with a export item in the bottom left. In that case 
tap the export item and then choose for 'Topo GPS' in the list with apps to import the file in Topo GPS. 

To import the geodata file in the case nothing happens, tap the icon of the person sending the file in top of the screen. Then tap 'info'. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to the section documents. Press 'Show all'. Here you see all documents that were sent by the person in the conversation. Tap the file, and then tap the export icon in the bottom. Then choose for 'Topo GPS' in the list of apps. Sometimes you need to scroll the list of apps to the left to see Topo GPS or you might even need to press 'More'.
