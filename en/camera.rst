Camera
======
If you tap :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Camera, the camera will be opened.
If you take a photo, a :ref:`waypoint <sec-wp>` will be created at your current location.
The photo will be added to the waypoint and can be shown by opening the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`.

The photo will also be saved in your photo library if you give Topo GPS access to selected photos of your photo library (iOS Settings > Topo GPS > Photos).

If you are recording a route you can include the waypoints with the photos in the route. If you save the recorded route make sure that the setting 'Include waypoints' is set to 'Near route'. Then all waypoints with photos that are loaded on the map and are near the route will be included in the saved recorded route.
