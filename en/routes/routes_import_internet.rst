Importing routes and waypoints from internet
============================================

Routes and waypoints can be easily imported from the internet into Topo GPS.

You can import the following file formats into Topo GPS:

- gpx
- zipped gpx (gpx.zip)
- kml and mkz
- OZI explorer track file (.plt)

Importing from Safari
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the internet there are a lot of websites that offer routes. Most often
these routes are available in the gpx format.

An example is displayed in the figure below. In Safari a `page <http://www.walkinenglishman.com/peakdistrict04.htm>`_ of
the website `walkingenglishman.com <http://www.walkingenglishman.com>`_
has been opened.

   :alt: Import route internet Topo GPS

   *Figure 1. The page ‘Mam Tor and Great Ridge’ from walkingenglishman.com.*

On the bottom of the page you can find a link to the gpx route file. If you 
press such a link an ‘Open in... ‘ pop-up will show up like in the figure
below:

   *Figure 2. Importing a gpx file from Safari.*

If you press ‘Open in Topo GPS’ the gpx file will be imported into Topo GPS. If you do not see ‘Open in Topo GPS’ you have to press ‘Open in....’ instead. A pop-up with will appear like in the figure below:

   *Figure 3. Importing a gpx file from Safari.*

You now have to press ‘Copy to Topo GPS’ to import the gpx file into Topo GPS. If you do not see the Topo GPS icon you have to scroll through the app icons. You can drag the Topo GPS icon to the front, so that next time you will be able to import a gpx file quicker.

After pressing ‘Open in Topo GPS’ or ‘Copy to Topo GPS’ the gpx file will be processed and the route will be displayed on the map, as you can see in the figure below:

   *Figure 4. The ‘Mam Tor and Great Ridge’ route from walkingenglishman.com has been imported and is displayed on the map.*

Imported routes are saved locally on your device. They will appear in the routes screen in the map that is currently opened. This is illustrated in the figure below:

   *Figure 5. The ‘Mam Tor and Great Ridge’ route can be found in the routes screen.*


Importing an URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can also enter an URL that points to a route file directly in Topo GPS.
If possible you should copy the URL so that you do not have to reenter it.
To copy an URL from Safari you have to press long on a link, and then choose ‘Copy’.

*Because of security issues in iOS 9, currently only https URLs can be imported correctly in Topo GPS 4.0. We are working on a solution so that in the next update also http URLs can be imported again.*

To import an URL you have to press first the :ref:`route button <subsec-route-button>` on the dashboard to open the :ref:`routes screen <ss-route-load>`. Next you press the ‘+’ button on the bottom of the routes screen. The import routes screen then appears. 
If you press the button ‘More import possibilities’ on the bottom, the following pop-up will appear:

   *Figure 6. More import possibilities in the import routes screen.*

You now have to press ‘URL’ in the pop-up. The following screen will then appear:

   *Figure 7. The import URL screen*

You can paste or enter your URL. If you are done you have to press ‘Import’ to import the URL. 

Below the URL box a number of websites with gpx routes is listed.
