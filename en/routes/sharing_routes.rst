Sharing routes with Topo GPS
============================

You can share a route with Topo GPS so that it can be :ref:`imported by other Topo GPS users <ss-routes-import-shared>`.
Only routes that you have recorded or planned yourself can be shared.

Shared routes including its photos are visible to all Topo GPS users and might in the future be accessible on a webpage.

To share a route with Topo GPS, tap the export icon in the bottom of the :ref:`route details screen <sec-route-details>`.

Then select 'Geodata' in the export pop-up and tap 'Export' to export the route. A share pop-up will appear in which you can select apps, as in the example below:

   *The share pop-up after exporting a route.*

In the share pop-up tap 'Share with Topo GPS'. Then a new pop-up will appear in which you can confirm sharing the route with Topo GPS.
