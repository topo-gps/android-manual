Planning routes
---------------
Planning a route is creating a route between several locations using a means of transportation. These locations are called route points in Topo GPS. An alternative to route planning is :ref:`route generation <sec-route-generate>`.

The route planner can be opened by selecting the tab 'Plan' in the bottom of :ref:`routes screen <sec-routes-screen>` (Dashboard > :ref:`Route button <ss-route-button>` or :ref:`Menu <sec-menu>` > Routes). The following screen will appear:

   :alt: Route plan screen Topo GPS
   
   *The route planner with no route planned.*

In the bottom of the screen you find an overlay with a search bar and several buttons which you can use to control the route planner.

To reset the route planner, you have to press 'More > Reset' in the planner overlay. The route points and the routes will then be removed.

To undo an action you have to press the ‘Undo’ button (circle with return arrow) in the planner. You can undo all actions in the planner until the
undo button becomes light blue.

To save a planned route, you have to press :ref:`'Save' <ss-route-plan-save>` button on the top right.

To zoom the map to your location, you can tap the position button in the bottom left of the overlay.

You can obtain more information about the route planner, by pressing 'Planner: Copyright', in the top left of the route planner screen.

Transportation means
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To plan a route, first check the transportations means in the bottom center. In the example above, it is set to 'Pedestrian'.
By tapping 'Pedestrian' a screen will appear in which you can change the transportation means to for example bicycling, car or as the crow flies.

If you plan a route as the crow flies or over a layer, you can do this without an internet connection. 
For the other ways of transportation an internet connection is required, because the routes are calculated externally. 

Adding route points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To plan a route you need to add route points. You can add route points in three ways:

- By entering a location in the search bar of the route planner overlay.
- By pressing long on the map and dragging the icon to the desired location.
- By tapping waypoints, the position marker, or nodes from a node network.

If you have added at least two route points, a route will be computed between the route points.

In the links below several examples of planning routes are discussed.
