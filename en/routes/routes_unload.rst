- By pressing on the title of the loaded route in the :ref:`routes screen <ss-route-load>`. Loaded routes will have a gray background color like in Fig. 1.
- By pressing ‘Unload all’ on the bottom of the :ref:`routes screen <ss-route-load>`. Then all loaded routes will be removed from the map at once.
- By tapping the loaded route the :ref:`route details screen <ss-route-details>` will be opened. You can unload the route by pressing ‘Unload’ on the top right of the :ref:`route details screen <ss-route-details>`.
