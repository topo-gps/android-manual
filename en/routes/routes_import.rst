Importing routes
================

In Topo GPS you have free access to a large collection of routes.
For a large part these routes have been made available by
users of Topo GPS through by sharing routes with Topo GPS.

In this section you can read how you can import these
Topo GPS routes. If you would like to import a gpx or kml/kmz route
you have to read on of the following sections:

   routes_import_e-mail
   routes_import_cloud

Import routes screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To import routes you first have to open the :ref:`routes screen <ss-route-load>`
by pressing the :ref:`route button <subsec-route-button>` on the :ref:`dashboard <sec-dashboard>`. Next you have to press the + button in the bottom right of
the routes screen. The import routes screen will then appear. An example is
displayed in the figure below:

Importing
~~~~~~~~~
In the import routes screen (Fig. 1) a list of routes is displayed, like in
the :ref:`routes screen <ss-route-load>`. If you press a route it will be imported and displayed on the map. As an example we now will import the route ‘Wairakei Huka Aratiatia’ from Fig. 1. The result is displayed below: 

.. figure:: _static/route-import3.png  
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Importing routes Topo GPS

   *Figure 2. The route ‘Wairakei Huka Aratiatia’ has been imported.*

Routes are imported from a Topo GPS server. Hence you should be connected to the internet in order to be able to view routes in the routes import screen and to import routes. An imported route will be stored locally on your device and can therefore be used offline. Imported routes will be saved in the :ref:`folder <ss-routes-organize>` that is currently active and will appear in the :ref:`routes screen <ss-routes-load>`.

Viewing route details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Often the title, route type and length do not give enough information to determine whether you should import the route. To view detailed route information you can press the info (i) button before importing a route in the routes import screen (Fig. 1). If you do this with the route ‘Wairakei Huka Aratiatia’ the following screen will appear: 

.. figure:: _static/route-import2.png  
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Importing routes Topo GPS

   *Figure 3. Route details of the route `Wairakei Huka Aratiatia`.*

In the route details screen a small map with the route is displayed, so that you quickly can decide whether the route is of interest to you. 

Optionally author details, photos and a description are displayed as well.

If you would like to import the route, you have to press ‘Import’ on the top right. The route will then be imported and displayed on the map.

With the ‘<‘ and ‘>’ buttons on the bottom of the screen you can browse through the list with routes. In the example of Fig. 1 you will see the route details of the route `Perniö K-kaupan ymparisto` if you press ‘>’.

Searching with keywords and filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By entering a keyword in the search box and by applying
a filter you can search in the routes that can be imported.

Searching with :ref:`keywords <ss-routes-search-keyword>` and :ref:`filters <ss-routes-search-filter>` functions in exactly the same way as searching in the routes screen and is explained in the section :ref:`ss-routes-search`.

Suppose you will go on vacation to Auckland, NZ and would like to import some nice walks in the surroundings. You then first have to :ref:`create a new filter <ss-routes-search-filter-create>` by pressing Filter > New Filter. As an example we now will create a filter for all Walking routes up to 100 km from Auckland. The new filter screen should then look as follows:

.. figure:: _static/route-import4.png  
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Importing routes Topo GPS

   *Figure 4. Creating a filter for walking routes around Auckland NZ.*

By saving filter, the newly created filter will appear in the filter screen. You now have to press on the filter to apply it. In our example the import routes screen then becomes:

.. figure:: _static/route-import5.png  
   :height: 568px
   :width: 320px
   :alt: Importing routes Topo GPS

   *Figure 5. Due to the filter only walking routes around Auckland NZ show up
in the import routes screen.*

The title below the search box indicates that only walking routes near Auckland are displayed. You can now import the routes by pressing on the titles, or you can view the route details as is done below:

   *Figure 6. Route details of the Maharani Regional Park hike, near Auckland.*

If you press the ‘<‘ and ‘>’ buttons you can browse through the walking routes near Auckland.
