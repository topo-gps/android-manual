Importing routes
================

In this section it is explained how to :ref:`import a route from a geodata file <ss-routes-import-file>`,
:ref:`from an url <ss-routes-import-url>` and how to :ref:`import routes shared by Topo GPS users <ss-routes-import-shared>`.

.. _ss-routes-import-file:

Importing routes from geodata files
-----------------------------------
It is possible to import routes in Topo GPS in the following file formats: gpx, kml/kmz, and geojson.
Files of these types can also be imported if they are compressed in a zip file.

To import route you could try to tap on a file icon. Most often an app picker will show up. Sometimes you need to scroll through the list of apps or tap More to find 'Topo GPS'. You then  have to select 'Open with Topo GPS' or 'Copy to Topo GPS' and the file will be imported in Topo GPS. 

Alternatively you could open the 'Routes tab' of the :ref:`routes screen <sec-routes-screen>`. Then tap More > Import file. Then the files app will be opened. Here you can select a cloud storage, like iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive. Then you can browse through your files and select the files you want to import.

If the routes were imported succesfully, you will return to the main screen, and the map will be zoomed to the imported routes. The imported routes will be saved on your device and can be found back in the 'Routes' tab of the :ref:`routes screen <sec-routes-screen>`.

How to import a geodata file from iMessage is explained in a :ref:`separate section <sec-imessage-import>`.
