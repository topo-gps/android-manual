Removing waypoints
==================
To remove a waypoint from your device you first have
to open the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`.

You can do this by pressing the info button right of a waypoint title
in the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>` or by
tapping a waypoint that is loaded on the map.

An example of the waypoint details screen is displayed below:

You can remove the waypoint by pressing the trash icon on the bottom of
the waypoint details screen. A pop-up will appear in which you have
to confirm the removal as is shown below:

If you press ‘Remove’ the waypoint will be removed from your device.

If you have enabled :ref:`iCloud synchronization of waypoints <ss-routes-synchronize-icloud>` the waypoint will also be removed from iCloud and from all devices that are synchronized with the same iCloud account.

It is also possible to remove waypoints from the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>`. Press ‘Select’ and :ref:`select <ss-routes-select>` the waypoints that need to be removed. Next press the trash icon on the bottom of the screen and confirm the removal.
