Unloading waypoints
===================

In the :ref:`waypoints screen <ss-waypoint-load>` (Menu > Waypoints) you can
unload waypoints from the map. An example of the waypoints screen is displayed in the figure below:

   *Figure 1. The grey background color indicates that the waypoint ‘Stonehenge’ is loaded on the map.*

The grey background color of the waypoint ‘Stonehenge’ indicates that that waypoint is loaded on the map.

If you press on a waypoint with a grey background color it will be unloaded from the map. 

You can also unload all waypoints at once by pressing ‘Unload all’ in the bottom of the waypoints screen.

It is also possible to unload a waypoint via the :ref:`waypoint details screen <ss-waypoint-details>`.
